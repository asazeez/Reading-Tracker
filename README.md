# Reading Tracker
Completed for COE 848 (Data Engineering) course. 

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a database system that efficiently tracks and manages a user’s reading activities. The system will let users record books that they are reading, categorize them, log reading progress, and share their reviews and ratings. Users will be able to organize their reading goals and activity into books they want to read, are currently reading, and have finished. This will help keep a record of books they have completed or plan to read in the future.

Users will be able to answer the following queries:
  1) How many books did I read this year?
  2) How many five-star books did I read this year?
  3) What are my top three genres?
  4) What are the books that I read this year?
  5) What were the highest and lowest rated books that I read this year?
  6) Who are my most read authors?
  7) How many pages are left of book X to read?
  8) What books am I currently reading?
  9) What books are on my “want to read” list?
  10) What is the reading status of book X?

Information is fetched from the database using MySQL commands ran through a Java application.
